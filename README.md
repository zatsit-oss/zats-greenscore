# zats-greenscore 🌱

A dynamic, **Astro**-based web application designed to assess the eco-conception score of digital projects.  

This project is inspired by the [API Green Score](https://github.com/API-Green-Score/APIGreenScore) initiative, leveraging their questionnaire from the provided Excel file to create an interactive and user-friendly experience. Please read their README file to understand the project philosphy.

## 🌍 Why This Project?

The [API Green Score](https://github.com/API-Green-Score/APIGreenScore) project offers a comprehensive method for evaluating the eco-conception of digital projects through its detailed questionnaire. However, the original format in Excel limits accessibility and user engagement. It is necessary to maintain the eco-designed aspect of the project to remain consistent with the approach, no need to replace an Excel file with a too much heavy project.

**Goals of This Project:**

1. **Dynamic Interaction:** Transform the static Excel questionnaire into a dynamic web app.
2. **Improved Accessibility:** Make the eco-conception scoring process more user-friendly and intuitive.
3. **Future Evolution:** Lay the groundwork for adding advanced features like new criterias, project scoring versionning, additional storage backends...

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
